Hello World for Weblate
=======================

Weblate is a web-based translation tool. It is based on `translate-toolkit` and
heavily relies on version control system to store and synchronize the
translations. You can find more information here, on <https://weblate.org/>.

This repository contains a sample translatable project that allows users to play with
Weblate.

You can try this project out on <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/sandbox/>.

The translation files are intentionally kept untranslated, so please do not
translate them. Pull requests to this repository will most likely be rejected
as it serves its purpose well as is (there are dozen of translations, all of
them are empty).
